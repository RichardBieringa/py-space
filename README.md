# Python pygame example

This repository was created to test the pygame library and create an example game.

Creating this project gave some cool insight on basic game design, which is a cool topic to dive into. Pygame as a high level framework provides many tools out of the box and makes it fun to explore with simple things, drawing on a screen and playing audio.

## If you actually wanna play this boring game

Its genuinly no fun, you can't win, you can only shoot some other ships.

```sh
$ poetry install,
$ poetry run game
```
